- 1/4 cup Chicken Broth
- 1 tbsp Oil

## Steps
1. Slice the pork tenderloin thin, to make this easier you can put a thawed tenderloin in the freezer for a moment so it is stiffer.
2. In a small bowl, whisk together all ingredients listed for sauce. Measure 1 tbsp of the sauce into a medium bowl and set the rest of the sauce aside.
3. Into the medium bowl, with the sauce, add the pork, cornstarch, and 1/4 tbsp. of oil. Mix to combine then cover and let marinade in the refrigerator at least 10 up to 30 minutes.
4. In another small bowl combine garlic pepper and 1/4 tbsp. oil
5. Heat remaining 1/2 tbsp. of oil in large pan or wok over medium high heat.
6. Cook vegetables until desired doneness and remove from wok, onions require about 7 minutes
7. Return empty wok to heat and add pork, break up any clumps that you see forming and cook for about 4 to 6 minutes, until you no longer see pink and water evaporates
8. Push pork to the sides and add garlic mixture to the center of the pan, pash the mixture into the pan and let cook for about 1 minute or until fragrant, finally stir the garlic and pork together.
9. Stir in vegetables, whisk sauce to recombine and add to pan.
10. Cook stirring constantly until sauce thickens, about 1 minute
11. Transfer to plate and let cool
