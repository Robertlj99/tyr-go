## Ingredients (serves 4):

- 2 cups pasta
- 2 cups rotisserie chicken, shredded
- 2 cups broccoli florets (fresh or frozen)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup plain Greek yogurt (full-fat or 2%)
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ½ cup milk
- Salt & black pepper to taste
- Optional: squeeze of lemon or a pinch of red pepper flakes
## Directions:

1. **Boil pasta & broccoli**: Cook pasta according to package. In the last 3–4 minutes, toss in the broccoli to cook with the pasta. Drain and set aside.
2. **Make creamy garlic base**: In a large skillet, heat olive oil and sauté garlic for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.
3. **Build the sauce**: Lower heat and stir in Greek yogurt, almond milk, and Parmesan. Whisk until smooth and creamy. Don’t let it boil—keep it on low so the yogurt doesn’t curdle.
4. **Mix in the good stuff**: Add chicken, cooked pasta, and broccoli to the skillet. Stir to coat everything in that creamy sauce.
5. **Season & serve**: Season with salt, pepper, lemon juice, or chili flakes if you want a kick.
