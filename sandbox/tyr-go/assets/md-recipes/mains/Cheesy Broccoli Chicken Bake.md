# Cheesy Broccoli Chicken Bake

## Ingredients
- 1 lb Chicken Breast cubed
- 2 cloves Garlic minced 
- 1/2 tsp Salt 
- 1/4 tsp Mustard Powder 
- 1/4 tsp Paprika 
- 1/4 tsp Pepper 
- 1 cup Rice 
- 1 cup Chicken Broth 
- 1.25 cup  Milk 
- 2 oz Cream Cheese
- 2 oz Cheddar Cheese 
- 3-4 cups Frozen Broccoli

## Steps
1. Preheat the oven to 400. Lightly grease the baking dish. 
2. Cube the chicken breast. Season with the minced garlic, salt mustard powder, paprika, and pepper. Stir to evenly coat. Add to the baking dish. 
3. Add the rice, chicken broth, almond milk, cream cheese, cheddar cheese, and broccoli. 
4. No need to stir, but make sure the rice is fully submerged. 
5. Bake for 15 minutes, then remove from the oven and stir. Add back to the oven and cook for about 10 more minutes, until golden brown on the top, chicken is cooked through and rice is cooked. If baking in one large pan, it will need to cook longer (probably about an hour, stir an extra time or two throughout cooking).
