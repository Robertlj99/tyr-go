# Creamy Chicken Pasta

## Ingredients (serves 4):

- 2 cups Pasta
- 2 cups Chicke Breast shredded
- 2 cups Broccoli Florets fresh or frozen
- 1 tablespoon Olive Oil
- 3 cloves Garlic minced
- 1 cup Plain Greek Yogurt 
- 1/4 cup Parmesan Cheese grated
- 1/2 cup Milk
- Salt & Black Pepper to taste

## Directions:

1. **Boil pasta & broccoli**: Cook pasta according to package. In the last 3–4 minutes, toss in the broccoli to cook with the pasta. Drain and set aside.
2. **Make creamy garlic base**: In a large skillet, heat olive oil and sauté garlic for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.
3. **Build the sauce**: Lower heat and stir in Greek yogurt, almond milk, and Parmesan. Whisk until smooth and creamy. Don’t let it boil—keep it on low so the yogurt doesn’t curdle.
4. **Mix in the good stuff**: Add chicken, cooked pasta, and broccoli to the skillet. Stir to coat everything in that creamy sauce.
5. **Season & serve**: Season with salt, pepper, lemon juice, or chili flakes if you want a kick.
